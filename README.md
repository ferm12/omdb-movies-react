This React App calls the http://www.omdbapi.com/ API to search for movies.
 
The only working functionality of the App right now is to search for movies that will match content according to the title. Please take a look https://moviesreact.ferminpureco.com

In the Future, I would like to add

•	Selection of different categories to search by title, Series or Episodes
  
•	Search parameter of release year.

•	The ability for the user to save movies under a 'My Content' tab 

•	The ability for the user to add comments to each individual movie saved in the 'My Content' tab
